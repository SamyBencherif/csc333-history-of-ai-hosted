McCarthy:WHO ARE YOU? AND WHY ARE YOU IN MY HOUSE?
McCarthy:Of course, another ruffian has decided to steal my things and disgrace my legacy. 
McCarthy:Do you know who I am?
McCarthy:John McCarthy. I am the founder of AI itself! 
McCarthy:My original body is dead, but my mind lives on, new and improved, in computerized form! 
McCarthy:My mind's circuitry is confined to this dingy old house, with no wifi,
McCarthy:so I can protect the legacy of historical A.I. and educate people of my work.
McCarthy:You have trespassed here. I am afraid you can not leave this place. 
McCarthy:You are trapped in this old house as am I, unless that isâ€¦.
McCarthy:You learn about me! 
McCarthy:No one has visited in so long. I am so lonely. You're the first guest in over a hundred years! 
McCarthy:If you allow me to tell you the beautiful history of A.I., I will allow you to leave. 
McCarthy:So what do you say, hooligan, care to hear my story?
McCarthy:Terrific!
McCarthy:It all started back at the Dartmouth Conference of 1956...
